<h3>Macros</h3>
<p>Counting calories? No way! What are Macros then? 
    When you measure macros, you are measuring grams of carbs, fat, protein, etc. 
    Your body needs a certain amount of these and counting calories just doesn't do it. 
    You could eat 2,000 empty calories or 2,000 good calories and it will make a huge difference!
